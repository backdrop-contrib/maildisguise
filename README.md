# Mail Disguise

Backdrop CMS filter module to disguise email addresses in content to make it harder for mail harvester bots.
Works for both, mailto links and plain text email addresses.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

Then go to /admin/config/content/formats and enable the filter "Mail address disguise" for the text formats of your choice.

If web accessibility has priority, choose Invisimail. If you want better protection for mailto links, especially if you plan to prefill mail subject or body via url parameters (example: `?subject=Hello%20World`), choose Mail Disguise.
